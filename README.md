# Wireless-Morse-Code-Communication-System
A peer-to-peer wireless communication system using Arduino Uno, a 16Ã—2 I2C LCD Display and NRF24L01 transceiver modules to transmit and receive Morse code messages.   This project demonstrates encoding text into Morse code, transmitting it wirelessly, and decoding it back into human-readable form.
